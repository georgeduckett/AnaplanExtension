Better Formula Editor for Anaplan
--
This project builds browser extensions (Chrome, Firefox and Edge) that enhance the Anaplan editing experience.


Building
--
Install NodeJS, install yarn, install java.  
Run `yarn all-dev` to update code from the latest Anaplan documentation, then build a development version (with source-link etc enabled).  
Run `yarn build-prod` to build the release versions.  
You can also run `yarn build-dev` to just build the development version of the extension without updating code from the Anaplan documentation (in case changes are needed to handle any changes to Anaplan's website before a successfull build).
